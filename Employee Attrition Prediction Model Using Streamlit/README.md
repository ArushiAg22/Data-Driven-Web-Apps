This project is to create Employee Attrition Prediction Model using Streamlit.

I have created a web app where we can see the data, select 1 or 2 attributes to display a graph(plot), train the model. All this just by clicking buttons.

I have also created an interactive pie plot where the user can select an attribute and value using a slider and see the pie plot which displays number of employees below and under the value set using the slider.
